## Fixed Files

### 1. `/actions/auth.action.js`
- Created auth actions for handling Google and credentials authentication
- Implements `signInUsingGoogle` and `signInUsingCredentials` functions
- Handles user authentication logic (currently with mock data)

### 2. `/app/login/googlelogin.jsx`
- Created a proper Google login component using NextAuth
- Uses NextAuth's `signIn` function with Google provider
- Includes loading states and error handling

### 3. `/app/login/page.tsx`
- Updated to use NextAuth for both credentials and Google login
- Replaced mock authentication with actual NextAuth integration
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Uses the new GoogleLogin component

### 4. `/app/providers.tsx`
- Created a client component to wrap the app with SessionProvider
- Required for NextAuth to work properly

### 5. `/app/layout.tsx`
- Updated to use the Providers component
- Ensures SessionProvider is available throughout the app

### 6. `/auth.js`
- Updated to properly implement credentials provider
- Uses the auth actions for authentication logic
- Includes proper callbacks for both Google and credentials

### 7. `/.env.local`
- Created environment variables file
- Contains NextAuth configuration variables

## Environment Variables Setup

You need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret-here
```

## How to Get Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" section
5. Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
6. Set authorized redirect URIs to: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local` file

## Features Implemented

- ✅ Google OAuth integration with NextAuth
- ✅ Credentials-based login
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Proper authentication flow
- ✅ Redirect after successful login

## Next Steps

1. Replace mock authentication in `actions/auth.action.js` with actual database integration
2. Set up proper user registration and storage
3. Add password hashing for credentials authentication
4. Implement user profile management
5. Add logout functionality where needed

## Testing

1. Make sure you have the correct Google OAuth credentials in `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Navigate to `/login`
4. Test both Google login and credentials login

The Google login should now work properly with NextAuth integration!
